    \n Credit cards are not a simple financial product and should not be used complacently.  In this lesson we will learn about how best to use them.
    \n \n Understand the basics: \n
    A credit card is a way of borrowing money that lets you  buy items now up to a pre determined credit limit and then pay later for them.  \n
    Payments for these items can be made in one go or in installments.\n
    Each time you spend, the amount will be added to the card\'s balance. This balance is the total amount you owe to the bank.</string>
